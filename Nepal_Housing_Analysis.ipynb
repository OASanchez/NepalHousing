    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the Nepal Housing Project by Osvaldo Sanchez, Megan Butts, Nick Mueth, and Chas Mosely\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are taking the data derived from the following Kaggle Data Set about Nepali Housing Prices:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/sagyamthapa/nepali-housing-price-dataset\n",
    "and using it to demonstrate data cleanup, wrangling, usage, modeling, and planning techniques we have learned in our CS433 - Data Analytics course at Southeast Missouri in the Spring of 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be cleaning up the data to make it more understandable for an American audience, as there is a wide variety of differences in culture and categorization between Nepal and the United States.\n",
    "After all cleanup is finished, we will move onto answer two main questions:\n",
    "1. Is the price of each property justified?\n",
    "2. What is the best value for someone of lower, middle, and upper class?\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we will show interesting and relevant facts and models to help summarize our findings in our conclusion."

    "Before cleaning up the data, the actual contents of it must be understood, as this is by far the most complicated data to clean up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Nepal, the metric system is not used, instead, they use their own forms of meausrement for weight and for length (such as this area).  Furthermore, those units of measurement are still separated into two different regions of Nepal, Hilly and Terai.  Along with that, certain areas in Nepal write out the main unit of measurement only, such as 20 Aana, and others write it out unit by unit with the most prominent unit being the one emphasized, but in relation to their area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***For example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "0-3-2-1 in the Hilly region actually means\n",
    "\n",
    "0 Ropani, 3 Aana, 2 Paisa and 1 Daam\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in the Terai region, it would translate to\n",
    "\n",
    "0 Bigaha, 3 Kattha, 2 Dhur and 1 Kanwa\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, square feet are still recognized as a valid unit of measurement in certain areas of Nepal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a final unit of measurement present in our data, which is Haat (misspelled in the data from the actual word Haath) which is smaller than all others, as it usually refers to a small amount of feet.  Bigaha is also misspelled as Bigha in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only unit of measurements which do not appear in our data from the listed units is Daam, all others technically appear in some form or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, having an understanding of the data and Nepalese culture, how can we cleanup data with so much variability in an eloquent way?  Simplifying it into a hierarchy, just as the Nepalese do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much how the Nepalese separate their measurements in hierarchical  order, we too can separate our data into a hierarchy using the following system from largest to smallest:\n",
    "1. Bigaha\n",
    "2. Ropani\n",
    "3. Kattha\n",
    "4. Dhur\n",
    "5. Aana\n",
    "6. Paisa\n",
    "7. Sq. Feet\n",
    "8. Haath\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know the actual measurements of these units, please visit the following link: https://www.nepalilanguage.org/numbers/#Unitsofmeasurement\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our method of computation will actually be quite simple, we will find the main keyword used in the area and assign it a numeric value from 1 to 8 which aligns with our hierarchy.  However, if the entry also contains dashes, we will check the first digit, and if it is not 0 and the keyword was Aana, it will be assigned a value of Ropani (2), and if the measure is in Kattha, it will be assigned a value of Bigaha (1)."

    "After looking to see the connection between cities and pricing with further investigation on bedrooms and bathrooms its easy to see that the city of Pokhara has more expensive housing with lots of bedrooms and bathrooms. Some cities have shown there isn't a huge difference in prices when it comes to the number of bedrooms like Bhaktapur and Kathmandu. Kathmando, however, shows that the higher number of bathrooms the higher the price is. Overall, we can't fully say that knowing where a house is located justifies the price. But knowing what city a house is located and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms can assist in understanding if the price is justified."

    "Although our more serious exploration was directed towards cities. We thought it would be interesting to see if the direction the house faces connects with the price of the house. We were intrigued by this because some cultures place high importance on the way the house faces and where the sun rises and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior knowledge tells us the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, but after research, it hardly rises and sets perfectly in those directions. It is more likely to rise and set more north or south of each direction. Because of this homes that face in a wester direction recieve more sun for longer and can be warmer then houses facing the eastern direction. Also from being in the sun longer, the doors and windows can get damaged quicker."

    "## Question 1 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at bedrooms, bathrooms, city, face, road type, and amenities, our group had a better understanding of how prices are determined for houses in Nepal. It is not just one feature that justifies the price of a house, but a group of features. Initially when we were looking at bedrooms and bathrooms, it seemed that the number of bathrooms had more value than the number of bedrooms. We looked at cities that the houses were located in and agreed that a city alone could not accurately answer our question of if the price is justified. It was a combined effort of city, bedrooms, and bathrooms. This was the similar case for road types as well. We found that some road types had more popularity than others but we wanted to see if it was because bedrooms and bathrooms played a role, which in the end they did. Amenities is also a key role in the price and could easily be seen as the price increased with the number of amenities listed. One feature we investigated than ended up having no connection with price was the way the house faces. We did outside reasearch to see what direction the sun rises and sets and what impact that has on a house's internal temperature and exterior features, but after that research we couldn't see a connection between price and face.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, looking at a house, examining number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, and the city can contribute to the price of a house."

Following that, a decent portion of houses are in the middle class range, and then only a few houses are in the upper class range. This makes sense due to the poverty levels in Nepal, with an average annual salary of only around 1000 USD.\n",

    "# Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind modeling is that by connecting information you can predict part of the information. In terms of this data, we will be trying to predict the price of the houses. To start off we can look at just the number of bedrooms in a house. Our intuition tells us that a house with more bedrooms will most likely cost more money. The average number of bedrooms in our data set is 2.7, so we will round up to 3. Here will be our first decision if a house has more than 3 bedrooms it will cost 300,000 and a house with less will cost 200,000. This is called a decison tree, but there are many more factors of price than bedrooms. To make our tree more accurate we will allow for more decisions or \"splits\". "

So in the case of our first entry our MAE is 747000 - 788500 = 41500, we use the absolute value as well. This way we have some sort of data to look at and say our predicition is off by so much. "

    "Our new MAE is a huge improvement upon the last but it is still not very accurate. In models we can overfit or underfit data. Overfitting is what we mentioned earlier where the model is so specific to the current data set it will be bad at interpreting new data. With our data still being so far off our problem is more likely to be underfitting. This is when even after splitting there is still too wide a variety of data to make predictions from. To fix this we can set how deep we want the tree and how many nodes it will have."

    "There are are over 100 different models to choose from in the sklearn library. Finding the right model for your project depends on what you are trying to predict and what your data is like. Our data has a few large outliers that sway our MAE. For the most of the data our tree model was quite close to the actual values. "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this project we started with a data set about Napali housing prices with the goal of creating a notebook that would make the data understandable for a wide audience. The first step was to clean and wrangle the data. After that was done we were able to examine the data and create charts and models to help explain it. We then asked our two questions:\n",
    "1. Is the price of each property justified?\n",
    "2. What is the best value for someone of lower, middle, and upper class?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleaning\n",
    "To clean up our data we started by removing some columns of data that either had incomplete data or were not relevant in helping our goals. The columns we kept we also had to work on. For the price column we converted the Rupee to USD so our American audience would understand it more. Another big fix in our data was converting the calender the Nepalese use to the stand Gregorian Calendar used in the US. Once again more converstion was needed, and we converted the Napalese measuring system. After all of this data was cleaned we were able to move to our questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1\n",
    "For the first question we looked at each factor that we thought could help contribute to the price: bedrooms, bathrooms, city, face, road type, and amenities. All play a factor in the cost but we created charts to see if some held more weight in the pricing than others. From this we learned that the correlation in road types had more to do with the other features than the road, and it was not that useful. Face also did not help to determine the price at all. After all our testing we found that bedrooms, bathrooms, amenties, and city help to determine the price of houses the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2\n",
    "Our goal for question 2 was to find the ebst value for someone in each class. Before we could find the best value, we first had to define what is lower, middle, and upper class. After doing some outside research our class definitions came to be \n",
    "\n",
    "Lower: <72,700 NPR (600 USD) per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Middle: >=72,700 NPR (600 USD) & <310,220 NPR (2,560 USD) per year\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper: >=310,220 NPR (2,560 USD) per year\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step after that was to seperate our data into the houses each class could afford. Just by looking at the average annual salary you can begin to understand how this data is going to shape up. With such a low annual salary it only makes sense that the majority of the population can only afford cheaper houses making the majority of our houses in the lower class bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "To create our models we started with the most basic decision tree and worked from there. We added more splits to our tree to allow it to work with more data. This is also where the data cleaning process becomes very important. If the data was still very messy the models would have a difficult time understanding the data and create poor models. After creating so many leaf nodes we tested the accuracy of our models with the MAE and improved from there. We tested for overfitting and underfitting to find the optimal amount of nodes to use for our data set.\n",
