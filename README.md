# Introduction
Welcome to the Nepal Housing Project by Osvaldo Sanchez, Megan Butts, Nick Mueth, and Chas Mosely.

In this project we are taking the data derived from the following Kaggle Data Set about Nepali Housing Prices: https://www.kaggle.com/sagyamthapa/nepali-housing-price-dataset and using it to demonstrate data cleanup, wrangling, usage, modeling, and planning techniques we have learned in our CS433 - Data Analytics course at Southeast Missouri in the Spring of 2020.

In this project, we will be cleaning up the data to make it more understandable for an American audience, as there is a wide variety of differences in culture and categorization between Nepal and the United States. After all cleanup is finished, we will move onto answer two main questions:

Is the price of each property justified?
What is the best value for someone of lower, middle, and upper class?
From there, we will show interesting and relevant facts and models to help summarize our findings in our conclusion.

# Contents
The contents of this project include the following:
1. Nepal_Housing_Analysis.ipynb - A jupyter notebook file containing python code.  This explains the data collected, processes used for altering, analyzing, and processing the data.
2. nepal_housing.csv - A CSV file that contains all the unaltered data originally obtained from Kaggle.com
3. Nepal_Housing_Report.docx - A document file which holds the same contents of the .ipynb file, but also has screenshots of the running results in case one does not wish to download Jupyter Notebook to run the project.  If one does, please continue to the next section.

# Running the Project
1. In order to run this project, please install Jupyter Notebook in order to run the Nepal_Housing_Analysis.ipynb file.
2. Please ensure that said file and the nepal_housing.csv file are in the same folder.  If they are not, the path will need to be changed within the Nepal_Housing_Analysis.ipynb file.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook and open the Nepal_Housing_Analysis.ipynb file.
4. At the top, restart the kernel and run all code again.  (The approriate button looks like a traditional fast forward button, it is to the right of the Run, Stop, and Restart buttons).
